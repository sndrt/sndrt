# Hi, 你好 I’m Sandra! 👋🏻👩🏻‍🎨👩🏻‍💻

![what my girlfriend thinks](https://i.imgur.com/4po9J7O.jpg)

I've been a graphic designer for the last 10 years and I am currently learning how to code🎓! I enjoy using creative solutions to solve real-life problems 🧠, I grew up playing video games 🎮 and I'm a also moderator for a discord gaming server. When I'm not designing or learning to code, I also enjoy karoke 🎵, camping 🏕️ and fresh seafood 🦐🦀🦞!
